### Overview
This project is a simple password strength checker built using Python. It evaluates the strength of a password based on length, character variety, and common patterns. A simple graphical user interface (GUI) is also included using `tkinter`.

### Features

- Takes into account:
  - Length of the password
  - Variety of characters (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters)
  - Commonly used passwords and repetitive patterns

- `tkinter` library (for the GUI)

To install `tkinter` on Debian/Ubuntu, run:
